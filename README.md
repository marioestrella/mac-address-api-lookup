# MAC Address API Lookup

## Description
The "MAC Address API Lookup" project is a Python program that queries the MAC address lookup API provided by alldatafeeds.com. It allows users to retrieve information about MAC addresses by providing the MAC address as input. The program sends a request to the API and returns the provided MAC address along with the corresponding OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) vendor company name. This tool is designed to assist network administrators, developers, and anyone working with MAC addresses.
